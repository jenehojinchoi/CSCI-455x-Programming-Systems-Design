DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLASS DESIGN AND ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES USED:

Class Design:

For this project, I used the second approach that is specified in assignment description.
The following are the descriptions of each class and functions defined in the class.

Class Rack:
This class creates a rack of scrabble tiles and finds all subsets.
The subset as a unique identifier is used as a key in AnagramDictionary class.
Also, letterFreqMap (TreeMap) is constructed to store unique characters in a word and corresponding frequency.

Class AnagramDictionary:
This class creates a HashMap that stores all anagrams of a word into the same hash bucket.
key is an alphabetically sorted word, and value is an array of its anagrams.

Class ScoreTable:
This class constructs a scoreTable. scoreTable is an array with a size of 26, (the number of alphabets).
According to the letter values in the PA4 description, I indexed scoreTable with character - 'a'.

Class WordFinder:
This class processes inputs from the user and start the word scrabble.
Inside the main function, I created startScrabble function. startScrabble creates a rack and takes inputs of words from the user.
Whenever there is an input of word, it calls getScoresBoard and print it.
getScoresBoard iterates through all subsets of the input word and saves a score of the anagram of the subset in a scoreBoard.
printScoresBoard then sorts subsets by scores and print the score of each word.
